# Indian-Currency-Recognition
A project for visually impaired people to recognise the bills of Indian National Rupee using Deep Learning technology.

### Dataset:
```
currency\
  ten\
  twenty\
  fifty\
  hundrad\
  fivehundrad\
  thousand\
```
dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7Am6-nOVeP7N1lQOUVUYlBuc0E/edit)

## Project sturcture based on [CS230 Deep Learning](https://cs230-stanford.github.io/project-code-examples.html)

Here is each file or directoryâ€™s purpose:
- ```data/```: contain all the data of the project, with an explicit train/dev/test split.
- ```experiments```: contains the different experiments (like base_model, learning_rate, batch_norm). Each directory (experiment) after training will contain multiple things:
  - ```params.json```: the list of hyperparameters, in json format
  - ```train.log```: the training log (everything print to the console)
  - ```train_summaries```: train summaries for TensorBoard
  - ```eval_summaries```: eval summaries for TensorBoard
  - ```last_weights```: weights saved from the 5 last epoches
  - ```best_weights```: best wieghts (based on dev accuracy)
- ```model/```: module defining the model and function used in train or eval.
  - ```input_fn.py```: where we define the input data pipeline
  - ```model_fn.py```: creates the deep learning model
  - ```utils.py```: utilitu function for handling hyperparams / logging
  - ```training.py```: utility functions to train a model
  - ```evaluation.py```: utility functions to evaluate a model
- ```build_dataset.py```: creates or trainsforms the dataset, built the split into train/dev/test in reproducible way.
- ```train.py```: train the model on input data, and evaluate each epoch on the dev set
- ```search_hyperparams.py```: run ```train.py``` multiple times with different hyperparameters
- ```synthesize_result.py```: expolre different experiments in a directory and display a nice table of the results
- ```evaluate.py```: evaluate the model on the test set (should be run once at the end of the project
- ```app/```: django project for interface

## Django Interface:
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
cd app
python manage.py runserver
```
- There is module called ```app/classifier/predict.py``` which builds the tensorflow CNN model based on your experments, preprocess the image and load the all weights saved in the checkpoints. To do that you need set model_dir path in ```app/classifier.py/view.py```. 
- Model builder code is same as the ```model/```
